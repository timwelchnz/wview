This is a mirror of https://github.com/jgoerzen/wview
I use WView on a Raspberry Pi and occasionally it dies with power flucuations and so I rebuild it.
Considering that as of May 2020 www.wviewweather.com is down and this repository hasn't been updated in 9 years
I decided it would be safe to make a copy of it for prosperity.

See wview-User-Manual.html or wview-Quick-Start.html for installation and documentions
